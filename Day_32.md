1. Started finding human users that would require MFA and approached them.
2. Was going through courses for some time because didn't have any active tasks or any access to complete active tasks.
3. Was assigned to a new task by Vijay, to take care of a new data sync task, old one, but will be run anew.
4. Went through the DAG and discussed with Jishnu about the approach.
5. Went through the Batch Load DAG and pointed out the changes required to make it work for the new table.
6. Pointed them out to Jishnu once he was free, then got him to work on it and run with changed configs in the server.
7. Work was done before lunch, then asked Surendra if he had anything on the DBT thing I could work on, even though I didn't have access, he pointed out that I didn't need it to proceed.
8. He asked to go through all columns and see what could be taken and what not, also to refer the previous DBT code written for SkorCard.
9. Spent the rest of the time working on going through each column individually and noting how filled and null they were.
10. Wasted some time as well.
11. Completed the thing, created pivots  and lookups.
12. Sent the message to Surendra and left for home.
13. At home, Surendra messaged asking about the uninstall logics and workflows, had to rexplain.
14. Then he asked about the links and running the workflow for all users.
15. Sent the links and replied that running for all users would require permission from Vijay.

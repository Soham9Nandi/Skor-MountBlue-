1. Inquired about failing Airflow to update data in Bigquery. Found that the data was not being updated, but the data didn't even seem to be required.
2. Reported to Vijay, that the workflow has been failing for a long time and that it can be deactivated as well as the data is not being used.
3. Started studying, continuing DE course.
4. Joined Data Scrum and got assigned to cleaning Adjust Data with DBT.
5. Asked for DBT access from Vijay, after confirming from Jishnu.
6. After returning from lunch, Jishnu assigned me to write a script for updating Snowflake accounts, making service accounts for the required ones and enabling MFA on others.
7. Surendra assigned on creating Clevertap DBT for Skorlife based on the one he had created for Skorcard.
8. Sushmita asked me to give some introduction to Abhishek(Mountblue Junior batch). I asked him to go through the topic for not more than 10 minutes each and then tell me.
9. Worked a little on the Snowflake accounts thing and then gave him the KT, very superficial.
10. Talked with Sushmita about his KT, and regarding new upcoming DE seniors, she said there won't be one, any time soon. Told it's creating pressure she told not to take pressure, bad move from my side.
11. I created the script for the Snowflake accounts.
12. Then Susmitha talked on how I had not messaged her the access I need to give the junior, then we talked and then I messaged her with those. She said, she came to inquire because I am usually proactive, and hence the delay didn't make sense.
13. I finished working on the DBT branch and raised a PR.
14. A lot of hurried errors from my side regarding the DBT task. Silly mistakes actually, but I was trying to complete it so fast that I made those mistakes and created a bad impression on Surendra.
